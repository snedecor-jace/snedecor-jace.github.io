**Walkability** is how easy it is to get around on foot in a certain area. Typically, more walkable areas have things like **higher densities** and **mixed-use zoning**, while less walkable places have things like **lower densities** and **strict zoning**.

## What Determines Walkability?
Walkability doesn't really have one standard definition that everyone uses, but there are several elements that make up walkability, including **safe and separated pedestrian infrastructure**, **safe pedestrian crossings**, **providing accessibiity to the less-abled**, **high density** and **access to and accomodation of a variety of transportation methods** including **walking** (obviously), **cycling**, **buses**, **trams**, **trains**, and **cars**. Walkability **doesn't** just mean excluding cars. There are many benefits to walkability, including a **healthier populace**, **cleaner environment**, and **stronger economy**.

## Is America Walkable?
Many places in America are unfortunately **heavily reliant** on cars. You simply can't get around in many American cities without a car. There's a lot of history that goes into this, and I could go into a lengthy diatribe about how car companies **sabotaged** American cities by **buying up** and **discontinuing** tram lines, **reframing discussions** on pedestrian fatalities to make it **your** fault if a car **hits you**, and **bulldozing hundreds** of city blocks and **thousands** of bulidings to build **financially insolvent** highways, but I won't; I have to finish this wiki at some point.

## Is Seattle Walkable?
Seattle, at least by North American standard, is very walkable. A bus network covers pretty much the entire city and the One Line is a vital part of the city's transportation network. Quite a few roads have separated bike lanes, though a city-wide bicycle network has yet to come to fruition. There's also a pretty small tram network downtown, and I have seen a few downtown intersections with signal priority for buses. Of course, many cities in Europe would likely blow Seattle out of the water in terms of walkability. There is a lot to look forward to, however! In the case of the One Line, the city plans on expanding it quite extensively! To find out more, check out the *third link*.
